Automatically generate and manage LLMS.txt files for LLM/AI content understanding, with full Yoast SEO, Rank Math, SEOPress, and AIOSEO integration.

== Description ==

**Website LLMs.txt** generates and manages an `llms.txt` file, a structured, AI-ready index that helps large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity understand your site’s most important content.

### How llms.txt works
Traditional sitemaps and robots files guide search engines. But as AI-driven systems such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity increasingly ingest web content, they benefit from a clear, structured list of a site’s most important URLs.
`llms.txt` offers that: a plain-text or Markdown list of essential public URLs, optionally annotated with titles, descriptions, and grouping, designed for AI consumption rather than general web crawling.

### Key benefits
✅ **AI discovery readiness** — future-proof your site for AI indexing and content retrieval.
✅ **Fully automatic** — the plugin builds and updates your `llms.txt` file on its own schedule.
✅ **SEO plugin integration** — works seamlessly with Yoast SEO, Rank Math, SEOPress, and AIOSEO, automatically excluding content marked as *noindex* or *nofollow*.
✅ **Advanced controls** — choose post types, customize file titles or descriptions, attach optional Markdown files, and trigger manual regeneration.
✅ **Developer-friendly** — includes filters such as `llms_generator_get_post_meta_description` for description logic, performance tuning, and custom indexing behavior.
✅ **AI crawler detection** — opt in to track whether GPTBot, ClaudeBot, or PerplexityBot are actually reading your site’s `llms.txt`.
✅ **WooCommerce & multisite ready** — respects product visibility rules and scales easily across large or networked sites.
✅ **Privacy-first experiment** — anonymous, encrypted telemetry helps reveal which bots are accessing `llms.txt` files across the web.

### Activation & setup
1. Activate the plugin.
2. Visit *Settings → LLMs.txt* to configure post types, update frequency (immediate, daily, or weekly), and optional crawler logging.
3. The plugin generates `llms.txt` (and optionally `llms-full.txt`) and serves it from your site root.
4. Content updates trigger automatic regeneration. All noindex/nofollow rules from your SEO plugin are respected.
5. If you enable AI crawler logging, local and global logs record each visit from known AI bots — viewable right inside your WordPress dashboard.

### Use cases for llms.txt
- Publishers, SaaS companies, developers, and documentation sites that want to make their content easier for AI systems to interpret.
- SEO-driven websites teting AI engine optimization tactics.
- Agencies and site owners preparing for the next phase of AI search and retrieval.

2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* screen in WordPress
3. Go to *Settings → LLMs.txt* to configure options and generate your file


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is llms.txt? =
`llms.txt` is a plain-text or Markdown file placed at the root of your domain (for example `https://example.com/llms.txt`) that lists your site’s most important public URLs. It helps large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity better understand your site’s structure and priority content.

= How does the Website LLMs.txt plugin work? =
The plugin automatically generates and maintains your `llms.txt` file based on published content. It pulls titles and descriptions from your site, respects SEO plugin settings (Yoast SEO, Rank Math, SEOPress, and AIOSEO), and excludes anything marked as *noindex* or *nofollow*. The file is then served from your site root, ready for AI crawlers to read.

= How often is llms.txt updated? =
You can set the update frequency in the plugin settings — immediate, daily, or weekly. You can also click “Generate Now” in the admin panel to rebuild the file at any time.

= Does this guarantee visibility in ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity? =
No. There’s no guarantee that any AI model will immediately use `llms.txt`, but it’s clear that several systems — including GPTBot, ClaudeBot, and PerplexityBot — are already crawling these files. Using `llms.txt` positions your site ahead of the curve as AI indexing becomes more structured.

= What’s the difference between llms.txt and llms-full.txt? =
`llms.txt` is a concise, curated list of key URLs.
`llms-full.txt` is an optional extended file generated by the plugin that includes a more comprehensive export of your site’s content. It’s useful for documentation sites, developer platforms, or large content hubs that want to expose additional structure to AI systems.

= What if my host doesn’t allow writing to the root directory? =
The plugin includes fallback logic for environments such as WordPress VIP or read-only hosting. In those cases, it serves `llms.txt` virtually through WordPress rewrite rules, so the file is still accessible at `https://example.com/llms.txt`.

= Does it work with SEO plugins like Yoast or Rank Math? =
Yes. It automatically integrates with Yoast SEO, Rank Math, SEOPress, and AIOSEO. Pages marked as *noindex* or *nofollow* in any of those plugins will be excluded from your `llms.txt` file automatically.

= Can I track which AI bots visit my llms.txt file? =
Yes. When crawler logging is enabled, visits from AI crawlers such as GPTBot, ClaudeBot, and PerplexityBot are recorded. You can view these visits in your WordPress dashboard. If you opt into the global experiment, your data is anonymized and encrypted before contributing to a shared dataset that tracks AI bot behavior across thousands of sites.

= Will it conflict with sitemap.xml or robots.txt? =
No. `llms.txt` complements your sitemap and robots file. Sitemaps tell search engines what to crawl; `llms.txt` helps AI systems understand what’s most valuable. They work together without overlap or conflict.

= Can I customize what appears in llms.txt? =
Yes. You can include or exclude specific post types, add a custom title or description, and even attach Markdown (`.md`) files to individual posts or pages. The plugin provides a straightforward settings panel and per-page controls for fine-tuning output.

= I’m a developer. Are there filters or hooks available? =
Yes. Filters such as `llms_generator_get_post_meta_description` and others allow you to modify how descriptions are generated or extend what metadata appears in the file. Developers can also adjust caching behavior, database queries, and output formatting.

= Is any personal data shared when I enable crawler logging? =
No. All telemetry is privacy-first. Local logs remain on your site. If you opt into the public experiment, only anonymized data (bot name, timestamp, and a hashed version of your domain) is shared. No content, user, or identifiable data is ever transmitted.

🛠 Improvements & Fixes

✅ Automatic AI Sitemap page generation
    • The plugin now auto-creates a public /ai-sitemap page explaining what LLMs.txt is and how it improves AI visibility.
    • The page is only created if it doesn’t already exist, and includes a dynamic link to your actual LLMs sitemap file.
    • Content is filterable for advanced customization.

✅ Added support for ai.txt as an alternate LLM sitemap path
    • The plugin now generates both /llms.txt and /ai.txt to maximize compatibility with future AI indexing standards.
    • Both files are kept in sync and contain the same URL list.
    • This improves discoverability by AI crawlers that look for ai.txt by default.

✅ Enhanced onboarding & reliability
    • Improved logic to prevent duplicate pages.
    • Cleaned up sitemap text formatting for better readability.
    • Hook-friendly architecture for developers.

🚀 This update makes your site even more AI-ready by exposing your content through both standard and emerging LLM indexing formats — paving the way for visibility in tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and beyond.

🛠 Improvements & Fixes

✅ Added support for AIOSEO plugin
    • Integrated detection of aioseo_posts table to improve filtering accuracy.
    • Posts marked with robots_noindex or robots_nofollow in AIOSEO are now correctly excluded from output.
    • Fallback-safe: the logic only applies if the AIOSEO table exists in the database.

✅ Enhanced compatibility with multiple SEO plugins
    • Filtering logic now handles both Rank Math and AIOSEO data sources.
    • Posts without SEO meta data are still properly included unless explicitly marked as noindex.

🚀 This update expands SEO plugin compatibility, ensuring more accurate output when working with AIOSEO-powered sites, and avoids accidental indexing of excluded content.

🛠 Improvements & Fixes

✅ Fixed issue with empty LLMS-generated files
	•	Resolved a bug where LLMS-generated files could appear empty if the rank_math_robots meta key was missing from posts.
	•	The plugin now correctly includes posts even if the Rank Math plugin is not installed or the meta field is not present.
	•	Prevented false negatives by ensuring the query accounts for both existing and non-existent rank_math_robots fields.

✅ Improved meta query logic for noindex handling
	•	Extended the meta_query to handle posts without the rank_math_robots key gracefully.
	•	Ensured that only posts explicitly marked as noindex are excluded, while all others (including those with no SEO plugin data) are properly included.

✅ Improved file generation accuracy
	•	Ensured that LLMS-related output files contain valid, expected content — reducing cases where generated files were blank due to strict filtering.
	•	Improved fallback logic for posts without SEO meta data.

🚀 This update ensures that LLMS-generated files remain accurate and complete, even on sites that don’t use Rank Math, and improves overall reliability when filtering content by SEO metadata.
