== Why Should You Use CTX Feed – The Best WooCommerce Product Feed Plugin? ==

As a WooCommerce store owner, creating and managing product feeds often feels like a nightmare.

From product rejections due to missing attributes, broken image URLs, and incorrect titles to the hassle of handling multiple formats like CSV or XML, most merchants waste hours fixing errors instead of selling.

Add in the frustration of keeping up with different channel requirements, currencies, or languages, and the process becomes overwhelming.

With years of experience and deep knowledge of different channel feeds, we’ve designed a plugin that simplifies your product feed management.

* **Zero Limits** – Handle 10 products or 10,000+ without restrictions.
* **130+ Channel-Ready Templates** – Instantly generate feeds for Google Merchant Center (Google Shopping), Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Bing Ads, eBay, Rakuten, PriceRunner, and more.
* **Error-Proof Feeds** – Automatic validation fixes GTIN errors, missing descriptions, invalid image links, and mismatched variants before submission.
* **Seamless Compatibility** – Works with all WooCommerce product types (simple, variable, subscription, bundles) and extensions (Dokan, WCFM, WPML, Polylang).
* **Flexible Export Formats** – Export to XML, CSV, TSV, XLS, TXT, or JSON—more options than any other WooCommerce feed manager.

Let’s Explore the Powerful Features of CTX Feed

= ☞ Unlimited Products =

Whether your store has hundreds or tens of thousands of products, CTX Feed lets you upload **every single item without limits**. Seamlessly push your entire inventory to all major channels—Google Shopping, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and 100+ more—saving you time and effort while ensuring nothing gets left behind.

You can create **as many feeds as you need**, no matter how big your store is. Each feed can include any number of products. Manage all your feeds easily in the **Manage Feeds** section, and quickly find the one you need by its name—no confusing URLs or complicated searches.

= ☞ 100+ Pre-Configured Templates =

With over 100+ ready-made templates, you can create product feeds in minutes without worrying about researching every attribute or requirement for each channel. Manually finding the right attributes  takes time and may not match the channel’s latest rules.

Using our pre-made templates, which are carefully built for each marketplace, ensures your feeds are accurate, complete, and ready to go—saving you time and avoiding errors.

This is a major release. Please update to version 6.0.0. Lots of issues were solved and a new UX/UI was added. Also, we frequently update the CTX feed plugin as our users need it. If any problem occurs while updating then reactivate the plugin. It's a good practice to make a backup of your database before updating.
